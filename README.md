# SQL-Hawaii-challenge

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database.

Precipitation Analysis includes the following:

A query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data with only the date and precipitation values selected.
Results were plotted using the DataFrame plot method.




Station Analysis includes the following:

A query to calculate the total number of stations.
A query to find the most active stations.
A list of the stations and observation counts in descending order.
A query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).
A histogram plotting the results of the temperature observation data.
